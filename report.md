# Abstract

Sumary should be concise (3-8 sentences) and to-the-point. It should address the following questions as briefly as possible:

- What is the task?
- What did we try?
- What results did we get using the techniques that we used?


# 1. Introduction

A detailed introduction to the problem statement that covers the following.

- The task
- Intro to the data
- Anticipated challenges. For example, data is imbalanced.

# 2. Methods


## 2.1: Histogram of Gradients and *ClassifierName*

### 2.1.1 Preprocessing
// What preprocessing techniques were used before HOG?

### 2.1.2 HOG

This section includes:

- Explanation of HOG without technical details. Use visuals tables, flowcharts if needed.
- Pros and cons of HOG a.k.a. when does it work vs when does it not work.
- Details of how features were extracted on Aerial Imagery dataset.

### 2.1.3 Classifier

- Which classifier(s) was used? Rationale behind using them with HOG. Maybe some classifiers work well on top of HOG features.
- Explanation of classifier(s) without technical details.


## 2.2: Convolutional Neural Networks

- What are CNNs?
- Rationale behind using CNNs.
-

# 3. Results

- What was the evaluation metric?

## 3.1: Histogram of Gradients + *ClassifierName*

- Implementation details.
- Model evaluation.
- Results - AUC

## 3.2: Convolutional Neural Networks

- Implementation details.
- Model evaluation.
- Results - AUC

# 4. Conclusion



# 5. References
