Prerequisites before starting the competition.

1. Make an account on Kaggle.

2. Revisit Git concepts. 
    - We're gonna collabroate using Git, so make sure that you know how to make a pull request and review others code. [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) is a good resource as provided in IDS705 assignment 1.
    - Then clone [this](https://github.com/arathee2/solar-panel-detection) repo and make your own branch (preferably with your name). This is the repository that we're going to use to collaborate.

4. Improve code-writing practices: 
    - Read PEP8 Python coding guidelines [here](https://pep8.org/).
    - Coding habits for data scientists. Read [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists) and [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-practices-data-scientists).
