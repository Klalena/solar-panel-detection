Prerequisites before starting the competition.

1. Familiarize yourself with computer vision and creating features from images. Link to some resources:
	- [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Vision](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-computer-vision/) \~3 minute read.
	- [Feature extraction in Python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d.html)

2. Familiarize yourself with deep learning in Keras. Link to recommended courses:
	- [Introduction to Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)
	- [Image Processing with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing)

3. Revisit Git concepts.
    - We're gonna collabroate using Git, so make sure that you know how to make a pull request and review others' code. [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) is a good resource as provided in the first assignment of IDS-705.
    - Clone [this](https://github.com/arathee2/solar-panel-detection) repo and make your own branch (preferably with your name).

4. [OPTIONAL] Improve code-writing practices: 
    - Read PEP8 Python coding guidelines [here](https://pep8.org/).
    - Coding habits for data scientists. Read [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists) and [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-practices-data-scientists).
