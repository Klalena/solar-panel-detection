# black-mamba
A supervised machine learning project.

# TODOS for 2/14:
1. [IMPORTANT] **Clone** this GitHub repository. **Create** your own branch (with your name) on your machine. You will **save** all your code in this branch inside the `./code/` folder and **push** it to the local branch on GitHub. For instance, I have made a local branch 'amandeep'. I will upload all my code to 'amandeep'. Ask me or any of your teammate if you're not sure about how to work with branches.

2. **Build your own machine learning model** to detect solar panels. It can be a simple logistic regression model or a complicated neural network. The point is to get a baseline AUC using a model of your choice. **Calculate the AUC** score using validation set or cross-validation. **Push the code** of this model to your branch and let your teammates know about your performance.

3. Read about **SIFT** and **HOG** image processing algorithms.


# TODOS for 2/10:
Prerequisites before starting the competition.

1. Familiarize yourself with computer vision and creating features from images. Link to some resources:
	- [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Vision](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-computer-vision/) \~3 minute read.
	- [Feature extraction in Python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d.html)

2. Familiarize yourself with deep learning in Keras. Link to recommended courses:
	- [Introduction to Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)
	- [Image Processing with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing)

3. Revisit Git concepts.
    - We're gonna collabroate using Git, so make sure that you know how to make a pull request and review others' code. [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) is a good resource as provided in the first assignment of IDS-705.
    - Clone [this](https://github.com/arathee2/solar-panel-detection) repo and make your own branch (preferably with your name).

4. [OPTIONAL] Improve code-writing practices:
    - Read PEP8 Python coding guidelines [here](https://pep8.org/).
    - Coding habits for data scientists. Read [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists) and [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-practices-data-scientists).
